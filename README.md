All things online certifications system

This an online certification system that was developed at Harare Institute of Technology in Harare Zimbabwe we welcome all contributors to contribute to this project regardless of race , color or age.

This a prototype of online certification with the capabilities to 

1. examine students
2. test students based on their interests
3. give them certificates after the test 


Some modules have been modelled in the backend but require efforts to be manipulated in the front-end 

Happy Coding !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
